# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts rainfall using **machine learning techniques** in Python. It uses weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure to train models like **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest** for forecasting rainfall occurrence or amount.  

## 📌 Features
- Preprocessing and cleaning of weather dataset  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Implementation of multiple ML algorithms  
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Easy-to-use prediction system for rainfall forecasting  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
